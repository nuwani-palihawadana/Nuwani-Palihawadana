    "text": "Better Forecasts through Better Choices: Optimal Predictor Selection for High-dimensional Nonparametric Forecasting\nDate: June 18, 2024\nEvent: Three Minute Thesis (3MT) Competition 2024, Faculty of Business and Economics, Monash University\nResult: Runner-up (Also competed as a Wildcard in the Monash University 3MT Competition 2024.)\nStatic Slide:  Script: On a scorching summer day, every moment outside feels like a battle against the heat. After running errands, you finally make it home. Rushing into the kitchen, you grab a glass, filled to the brim with icy-cold water, and switch on the AC. But, even before you fully enjoy that cooling breeze, “Click”… the power goes out. In an instant, you are drenched in sweat all over again.\nDoesn’t sound great, right?\nPower cuts can occur due to bad weather, damage to infrastructure, or even regular maintenance. But did you know that electricity regulators sometimes deliberately cut power, simply because they are unprepared to meet the demand? This unpreparedness directly falls on to not having accurate predictions for the future.\nElectricity demand depends on several factors such as prevailing weather conditions, calendar effects, demographics, and even economic factors. Temperature, for example, is obviously related to electricity demand. Not only current temperature, but at least a week of historical temperatures, can influence electricity demand at a given time.\nIn this case, statisticians develop a model combining such current and historical information to produce forecasts. However, feeding all the available information into a model does not produce accurate forecasts. Hence, it is important to determine which information is relevant, and which is not. This is where expert knowledge comes in. As this is very subjective, having a principled and a more objective method is a pressing requirement.\nMy research addresses this problem. I’m developing an optimisation algorithm that automatically identifies the most important information and discards unimportant information without the need for expert knowledge. This algorithm takes all the historical information that we provide as inputs, uses algorithmic reasoning to combine the inputs into groups, and explores the possibly complicated relationships between the past and the future. The result is an optimised model that can produce forecasts with better predictive accuracy.\nNow you might wonder, does this algorithm only solves the electricity demand problem? Not really! I’m developing a general algorithm that you can use in almost any forecasting problem: you may try to forecast mortality, sales, or groundwater level. I got you covered!\nI’ve used this algorithm to forecast mortality and solar intensity. It has shown promising accuracy improvements compared to benchmark methods. Therefore, once completed, my research will be another step forward in statistical forecasting!"

    "text": "RESEARCH\nPhD Thesis: Optimal Predictor Selection for High-dimensional Nonparametric Forecasting\nSummary: This thesis investigates nonparametric additive index models as a forecasting framework, with a focus on automating predictor selection, predictor grouping, and model estimation—thereby reducing reliance on prior knowledge or domain expertise. To this end, it proposes the Sparse Multiple Index (SMI) Modelling algorithm, which estimates such models through an L0- and L2-regularised non-linear least squares optimisation problem with linear constraints, solved via mixed-integer programming. The algorithm simultaneously performs predictor selection and grouping with minimal user input. Empirical applications to forecasting heat exposure-related daily mortality and daily solar intensity demonstrate the method’s competitive forecasting performance. The thesis further investigates methods for generating prediction intervals to quantify forecast uncertainty in nonparametric additive models. It evaluates the standard block bootstrap approach and three established conformal prediction methods. In addition, it proposes a novel method—Conformal Bootstrap (CB)—which integrates block bootstrap resampling and split conformal prediction into a unified procedure for constructing prediction intervals. Finally, the thesis presents an open-source R package, smimodel, to facilitate the practical application of the proposed methodologies.\nUndergraduate Thesis: Generalising Vector Autoregressive (VAR) Model for Functional Time Series\nSummary: This study generalises the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model—a widely used multivariate time series model in classical time series analysis—to the context of functional time series. For theoretical simplicity, it introduces the Functional Vector Autoregressive model of order one (FVAR(1)), focusing on two functional time series, as higher-order FVAR models can be readily converted to an FVAR(1) form. The proposed model naturally extends the univariate Functional Autoregressive model of order one (FAR(1)), since FVAR(1) can be expressed in an equivalent FAR(1) form. Under the assumption of stationary time series and another key assumption, the model is shown to have a unique, stationary and convergent solution. The practical application of the FVAR(1) model is demonstrated using daily temperature data for Colombo from 2007 to 2012, obtained from the Department of Meteorology, Sri Lanka."
