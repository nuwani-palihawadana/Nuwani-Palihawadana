    "text": "I am a Ph.D.¬†candidate in the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics, Monash University, Australia, supervised by Prof.¬†Rob J. Hyndman, Dr Xiaoqian Wang, and Prof.¬†Louise M. Ryan. I am currently working on a project titled ‚ÄúOptimal Predictor Selection for High-dimensional Nonparametric Forecasting‚Äù.\nI am part of Monash NUMBATs, and a research student at OPTIMA and ACEMS.\nMy research focuses on Statistical Forecasting, Classical and Functional Time Series Analysis, and Predictive Modelling. As a passionate novice, I am dedicated to developing open-source software tools that support reproducible research. You can check out my most recent R package here, which is developed to provide functions to estimate Sparse Multiple Index (SMI) Models for nonparametric forecasting, with simultaneous predictor selection and predictor grouping."

After running errands, you finally make it home. Rushing into the kitchen, you grab a glass, filled to the brim with icy-cold water, and switch on the AC. But, even before you fully enjoy that cooling breeze, ‚ÄúClick‚Äù‚Ä¶ the power goes out. In an instant, you are drenched in sweat all over again.\nDoesn‚Äôt sound great, right?\nPower cuts can occur due to bad weather, damage to infrastructure, or even regular maintenance. But did you know that electricity regulators sometimes deliberately cut power, simply because they are unprepared to meet the demand? This unpreparedness directly falls on to not having accurate predictions for the future.\nElectricity demand depends on several factors such as prevailing weather conditions, calendar effects, demographics, and even economic factors. Temperature, for example, is obviously related to electricity demand. Not only current temperature, but at least a week of historical temperatures, can influence electricity demand at a given time.\nIn this case, statisticians develop a model combining such current and historical information to produce forecasts. However, feeding all the available information into a model does not produce accurate forecasts. Hence, it is important to determine which information is relevant, and which is not. This is where expert knowledge comes in. As this is very subjective, having a principled and a more objective method is a pressing requirement.\nMy research addresses this problem. I‚Äôm developing an optimisation algorithm that automatically identifies the most important information and discards unimportant information without the need for expert knowledge. This algorithm takes all the historical information that we provide as inputs, uses algorithmic reasoning to combine the inputs into groups, and explores the possibly complicated relationships between the past and the future. The result is an optimised model that can produce forecasts with better predictive accuracy.\nNow you might wonder, does this algorithm only solves the electricity demand problem? Not really! I‚Äôm developing a general algorithm that you can use in almost any forecasting problem: you may try to forecast mortality, sales, or groundwater level. I got you covered!\nI‚Äôve used this algorithm to forecast mortality and solar intensity. It has shown promising accuracy improvements compared to benchmark methods. Therefore, once completed, my research will be another step forward in statistical forecasting!"
