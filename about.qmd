I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics, Monash University, Australia](https://www.monash.edu/business/research/our-researchers/graduate-research-students-and-supervisors?queries_degree_query=Econometrics+and+Business+Statistics&queries_degree_query_posted=1&result_1619149_result_page=3), supervised by [Prof. Rob J. Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com/), [Dr Xiaoqian Wang](https://xqnwang.rbind.io/), and [Prof. Louise M. Ryan](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Louise.M.Ryan). I am currently working on a project titled *"Optimal Predictor Selection for High-dimensional Nonparametric Forecasting"*.

I am part of [Monash NUMBATs](https://numbat.space/), and a research student at [OPTIMA](https://optima.org.au/) and [ACEMS](https://acems.org.au/our-people/nuwani-palihawadana).

My research focuses on Statistical Forecasting, Classical and Functional Time Series Analysis, and Predictive Modelling. As a passionate novice, I am dedicated to developing open-source software tools that support reproducible research. You can check out my most recent R package [here](https://github.com/nuwani-palihawadana/smimodel), which is developed to provide functions to estimate Sparse Multiple Index (SMI) Models for nonparametric forecasting, with simultaneous predictor selection and predictor grouping.
